* `Google Protocol Buffers <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`_
  >= 2.5.0 (earlier versions might work, but are untested)


Installation
------------

All the magic should be done by::

$ python setup.py install


Test the Installation
---------------------

To test the installation start the QRSim TCP server from MatlabÂ®
with::

>> QRSimTCPServer(10000)

Then run::

$ python -m qrsim.testclient 127.0.0.1 10000
